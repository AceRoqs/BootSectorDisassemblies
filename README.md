In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I did a bunch of assembly code
for various projects.  Much of this code was either for my own
operating systems projects or my own games.

I spent a fair amount of time reverse engineering code for various
reasons.  I was interested in writing boot loaders, and I reversed
a number of boot sectors, which are included here.  They are here
for my own documentation, and are mostly obsolete except perhaps as
a historical reference.

I was likely one of the first persons to use the Netwide Assembler
\([www.nasm.us](http://www.nasm.us)\) to its full extent, as I used
it for assembly code in DJGPP projects, writing 16 and 32-bit code for
Win32 and my own OSes, and for reassembling byte-accurate
disassemblies.  These disassemblies all reassemble correctly for
NASM 2.09.08, which was the latest available as of this submission.

For anyone evaluating me for hire, I have also reversed several viruses
which are considerably more complex than these boot sectors.  I
can walk interviewers through these disassemblies in person, on
request.  Some of the more interesting I would suggest include
[Exebug](http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/exebug.shtml) and
[Commander Bomber](http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/bomber.shtml),
which are dozens of pages of source code.
